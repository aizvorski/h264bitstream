0.1.7 - in progress as of 2012-01-10

0.1.6 - released 2007-06-03
- initial support for SEI
- rbsp_to_nal and nal_ro_rbsp conversion functions callable from the outside (also allows using any *_rbsp function directly as long as the appropriate conversion is performed)
- support for access unit delimiters (AUD)
- many constants with special meanings now have their own defines, and also print out a description in debug_*
- correct handling on single slice type-only slices (slice_type >= 5), both for reading and writing
- full support for files larger than 2GB in h264_analyze
- output of h264_analyze and debug_* functions uses decimal instead of hex (most cases)
- fix for cases in which no nal is found in entire buffer in h264_analyze
- inline many bs_* functions using portable "static inline" syntax
- slice data read/write (work in progress, not yet functional)
- fixed writing with emulation_prevention_three_byte again - off-by-one error
- added defines for rplr and mmco

0.1.5 - released 2006-07-22
- added readme, changes, todo files
- added doxygen documentation for public api
- added h264_new and h264_free functions
- read_nal_unit detects end of nal correctly
- read_nal_unit and write_nal_unit now return actual length read/written
- added defines for nal unit types
- fixed emulation_prevention_three_byte handling in write_nal_unit
- fixed bugs in read/write_rbsp_trailing_bits

0.1.4 - released 2005-10-19
- moved bs.{c,h} into separate files
- header include more than once is ok
- changed some notices
- update manifest and makefile
- print usage
- minor fixes

0.1.3 - released 2005-10-12
- first public release
- status: implements ALL of H264 standard, except for: SEI (7.3.2.3), slice data partitions (7.3.2.9), slice data, and a few other parts described in the code. Partly implements decoded reference picture marking and reference picture list reordering (data is read but discarded; cannot write). No consistency or range checks.
